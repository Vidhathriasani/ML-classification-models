# Machine Learning Classification Projects

This repository contains machine learning projects focused on **classification tasks**.  
It uses real-world datasets such as the **Titanic** dataset and the **Glass Identification** dataset to build and evaluate predictive models.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Handling categorical and numerical features.  
  - Train-test splitting.  

- **Model Training**  
  - Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.  
  - Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

- **Datasets Used**  
  - **Titanic Dataset**: Predict passenger survival based on age, class, gender, and other factors.  
  - **Glass Identification Dataset**: Predict type of glass based on its chemical composition.  

## Requirements
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
